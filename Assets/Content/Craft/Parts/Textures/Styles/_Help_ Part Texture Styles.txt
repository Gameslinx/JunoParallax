New part texture styles can be created via the PartManager object. A part texture style is a detail texture and normal map texture set that can be applied to a part. The detail textures should go in the 'Detail' folder and the normal maps should go in the 'Normal' folder, otherwise the textures and styles may fail to be included in the mod. A TextureStyles.xml file will be automatically created and updated in the Resources folder when texture style assets change.
