Meshes used for parts should be added here. Code runs during the mesh import process that may modify mesh UVs for various purposes. The _PartModelImportData object can be used to control how the mesh is imported during this process. Part meshes should be added to the model list for the importer. Once tracked by the importer, you can specify which subpart a mesh belongs to (useful for using different textures on a single part). You can also specify which material level (Primary, Trim1, etc.) is associated with each submesh. Make sure to click the 'Save Changes' button to apply any changes made to the importer. If a mesh fails to import correctly due to compiler errors or other problems, you can always right click on a mesh and select 'Reimport'.
